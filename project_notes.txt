You need to make sure that rosters are separate for the different leagues a user belongs to.








Lineups - draft 7 play 4 - lock in @ first tee time (time zone dependent) (if LATE, take top four guys listed and half the points.)

Free Agency pool - chosen by president, add/drop functionality for admin, Mike always admin. [terms for free agency] - need to track how many free agency transactions a user has done, and then total points for season --> ONLY ALLOWED 2 PER MONTH -- countdown until free agent pickup is complete [any 12 hour block up through midnight PST Wednesday]

Trades - user needs to be able to look at everyone elses roster, and then propose trade (all player stats)  ==> propose/approve model

if roster.length < 7 (after trade), you can pick free agents(through normal free agent channels)
