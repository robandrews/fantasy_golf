-User profile refactor eventually - important because we need to keep track of several league dependent metrics [number of free agency pickups, rosters, etc]

-The free agent pool should not include players that are taken by other members of the league

-Trade interface/routes/schema

Trade schema

-trade proposer
-trade proposee
-proposer player group
-proposee player group

We could make a player group polymorphic - use that for both rosters and trades

need to make a bylaws controller - allow for editing using htmyl5 and individualized bylaws on a per-league basis

general optimization including prefetching message replies, among several others

Trades - user needs to be able to look at everyone elses roster, and then propose trade (all player stats)  ==> propose/approve model

IR list (field in the player schema)
